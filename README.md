# morsecode_arduino

Aim of this application is to create a system that can encrypt characters that will be entered via a keyboard in the corresponding Morse code and then decode the Morse code and return the text that was originally entered. To achieve that two Arduino Uno are used one as a transmitter and the other as
receiver of Morse signals. The Morse transmitter is pumping electricity from  USB connected to the computer so that it exists
